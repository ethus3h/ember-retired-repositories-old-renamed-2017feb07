Tokeniser test
==============
This directory contains a set of tools for checking the behaviour
of the tokeniser for Metacity theme files.

tokentest.ini contains a list of all expressions retrieved from
all theme files on art.gnome.org, and mappings to what the tokenising
should be, in a separate representation.  get-tokens.py produces the
template version of this; it will produce a file with no expected
values.

tokentest.c will either check that a tokeniser behaves according to
tokentest.ini, or, if it finds a file, is empty it will print the
values that the tokeniser it's using is producing.

The makefile is a hacky attempt at letting you compile either against
Metacity's existing tokeniser or one which uses GLib's "scanner".

This code may or may not eventually end up in the automated test suite.
