This is GStreamer Libav Plugins 1.0.8

Changes since 1.0.7:

      * gst-libav: internal libav snapshot version bumped to v0.8.8

Changes since 1.0.6:

      * Update to libav 0.8.6
      * Now uses frame based threading if possible and disables slice

        performance and fixes some display corruptions caused by bugs in the
        slice based threading
