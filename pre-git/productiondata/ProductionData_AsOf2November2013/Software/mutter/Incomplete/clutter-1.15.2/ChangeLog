    clutter-text: prevent text buffer creation if not needed
    
    When allocating or asking for preferred width/height on a ClutterText,
    it can notify a change on buffer/text/max-length if no text has been
    set.

    actor: Deprecate realize and unrealize
    
    There is no reasonable use case for having the functions, the virtual
    functions, and the signals for realization and unrealization; the
    concept belongs to an older era, when we though it would have been
    possible to migrate actors across different GL contexts, of in case a GL
    context would not have been available until the main loop started
    spinning. That is most definitely not possible today, and too much code
    would utterly break if we ever supported that.

    wayland: Use a fake millisecond monotonic time source for event times
    
    The majority of Clutter input events require a time so that that the
    upper levels of abstraction can identify the ordering of events and also
    work out a click count.
    
    Although some Wayland events have microsecond timestamps not all those
    that Clutter expects do have. Therefore we would need to create some
    fake times for those events. Instead we always calculate our own time
    using the monotonic time.

    paint-nodes: Use the correct wrap mode for TextureNode
    
    If we allow content repeats on the texture nodes, then we need to use
    the "automatic" wrap mode for the texture layer in the pipeline, instead
    of the clamp-to-edge one.

    conform: Use a repaint function
    
    Timeouts and idles are subject to the whims of the load of the machine
    running the tests, as we found out with the new installed tests and
    OSTree-based VM running the conformance test suite continuously.
    
    We should be able to use a repaint function and a blocking loop that
    either is terminated because we hit g_assert(), or because a flag gets
    toggled once we know that the Stage has been at least painted once.
    
    The currently enabled tests using clutter_stage_read_pixels() have been
    updated to this approach.

    wayland: make the surface toplevel when showing the stage
    
    Cogl (as of 0b2b46ce) now only sets the shell surface as toplevel when
    the CoglOnscreen is shown.
    
    Without calling wl_shell_surface_set_toplevel the compositor will not
    know what role to give to the compositor and thus the stage will not
    appear.
    
    When we look to support multiple roles / foreign surfaces we will need
    to revisit this call and ensure we only call it when we are working in
    the default case.

    wayland: Do not poll the Wayland socket for events
    
    Since Cogl also polls on this file descriptor we can get into situations
    where our event source is woken up to handle events but those events
    have instead been handled by Cogl resulting in the source sitting in
    poll().
    
    We can safely rely on Cogl to handle the polling on the event source and
    to dispatch those events.

    unnoticed because we usually build the Wayland client backend
    with the X11 backend.

    clutter-offscreen-effect: Allocate the cogl texture directly
    
    Cogl now lazy loads the textures so we cannot rely on getting NULL
    from cogl_texture_new_with_size so we have to allocate it by ourselves.

    actor: Remove the was_painted flag
    
    While we still don't want to perform implicit transitions on unmapped
    actors, we can relax the requirement on having been painted once; the
    was_painted flag was introduced to avoid performing implicit transitions
    on the :allocation property, but for that we can use the
    needs_allocation flag instead, as needs_allocation will be set to FALSE
    when we have been painted as well.
    
    Thus, we retain our original goal of not having actors "flying" into
    position on their first allocation, without the side effect of
    preventing animations when emitting the ::show signal.

    Now, if we clear the constraints or the actions on an actor, and we
    call has_constraints() or has_actions(), we get an false positive.

    offscreen-effect: limit offscreen fbo size to the stage's size
    
    When using a ClutterOffscreenEffect, the size of the offscreen buffer
    allocated to perform the effect is currently computed using the paint
    volume of the actor it's attached to and in the case the paint volume
    cannot be computed, the effect falls back to using the stage's size.
    
    If you scale an actor enough so its paint volume is much bigger that
    the size of the stage, you can end up running out of memory (which
    leads to your application crashing).

    actor: Improve conditions for skipping implicit transitions
    
    The "should this implicit transition be skipped" check should live into
    its own function, where we can actually explain what it does and which
    conditions should be respected.
    
    Instead of just blindly skipping actors that are unmapped, or haven't
    been painted yet, we should add a couple of escape hatches.
    
    First of all, we don't want :allocation to be implicitly animated until
    we have been painted (thus allocated) once; this avoids actors "flying
    in" into their allocation.
    
    We also want to allow implicit transitions on the opacity even if we
    haven't been painted yet; the internal optimization that we employ in
    clutter_actor_paint() and skips painting fully transparent actors is
    exactly that: an internal optimization. Caller code should not be aware
    of this change, and it should not influence code outside of ClutterActor
    itself.
    
    The rest of the conditions are the same: if the easing state's duration
    is zero, or if the actor is both unmapped and not in a cloned branch of
    the scene graph, then implicit transitions are pointless, as they won't
    be painted.

    stage: Use precomputed constants instead of trigonometric functions
    
    This should actually ensure that the calculations of the Z translation
    for the projection matrix is resolved to "variable * CONSTANT". The
    original factors are left in code so it's trivial to revert to the
    trigonometric operations if need be, even without reverting this commit.

    stage: Add a paint callback
    
    The ClutterActor::paint signal is deprecated, and connecting to it even
    to get notifications will disable clipped redraws because of violations
    of the paint volume.
    
    The only actual valid use case for notifications of a successful frame
    is on the ClutterStage, so we should add new (experimental) API for it,
    so that users can actually subscribe to it — at least if you're writing
    a compositor.
    
    Shoving a signal in a performance critical path is not an option, and
    I'm not sure I want to commit to an API like this yet. I reserve the
    right to revisit this decision in the future.

    canvas: Allow invalidating the content along with the size
    
    Currently, clutter_canvas_set_size() causes invalidation of the canvas
    contents only if the newly set size is different. There are cases when
    we want to invalidate the content regardless of the size set, but we
    cannot do that right now without possibly causing two invalidations,
    for instance:
    
      clutter_canvas_set_size (canvas, new_width, new_height);
      clutter_content_invalidate (canvas);
    
    will cause two invalidations if the newly set size is different than
    the existing one. One way to work around it is to check the current
    size of the canvas and either call set_size() or invalidate() depending
    on whether the size differs or not, respectively:
    
      g_object_get (canvas, "width", &width, "height", &height, NULL);
      if (width != new_width || height != new_height)
        clutter_canvas_set_size (canvas, new_width, new_height);
      else
        clutter_content_invalidate (canvas);
    
    this, howevere, implies knowledge of the internals of ClutterCanvas,
    and of its optimizations — and encodes a certain behaviour in third
    party code, which makes changes further down the line harder.
    
    We could remove the optimization, and just issue an invalidation
    regardless of the surface size, but it's not something I'd be happy to
    do. Instead, we can add a new function specifically for ClutterCanvas
    that causes a forced invalidation regardless of the size change. If we
    ever decide to remove the optimization further down the road, we can
    simply deprecate the function, and make it an alias of invalidate()
    or set_size().

    text: Add ::cursor-changed signal
    
    Since we are trying to eliminate the ClutterGeometry type, we should
    replace the only entry point still using it: the ::cursor-event signal
    of ClutterText.
    
    Instead of passing the cursor geometry, we should add an accessor
    function.
    
    The combination of signal and getter for the cursor geometry means that
    we can deprecate ClutterText::cursor-event, and mark it for removal in
    Clutter 2.0.

    wayland: Queue a redraw after showing the stage
    
    On the other backends we will get some sort of expose event after
    showing the stage's window which will queue a redraw. These expose
    events don't exist on Wayland so nothing will cause Clutter to queue a
    redraw. Weston doesn't bother displaying anything for the stage's
    surface until the first buffer is sent, which of course it will never
    receive if Clutter doesn't paint anything. This patch just makes it
    explicitly queue a redraw after the stage is shown so that we will
    always pass at least one frame to the compositor.
    
    The bug can be seen by running test-stage-sizing. That example doesn't
    have any animations so it won't try to queue any redraws until
    something interacts with it. On the other hand something like
    test-actors works fine without the patch because it constantly queues
    redraws anyway in order to display the animation.

    clutter: Prefer the X11 backend to the Wayland one
    
    If clutter is built with both X11 and Wayland support, prefer the
    (more complete for now) X11 backend. This matches GTK+'s current
    ordering.
    
    This allows distributions to ship a clutter version with both backends
    built, and using an envvar to switch to the wayland backend and test
    applications.
    
    In the future, applications would be able to choose which backend
    they prefer and in which order.

    actor: Skip transitions on invisible actors
    
    If an actor has not been painted yet, or it's not going to be painted,
    we can ignore transitions queued on it.
    
    By ignoring transitions on actors that have not been painted yet, we can
    avoid doing work during the set up phase of the scene graph, as well as
    avoiding actors "flying in" from nowhere.
    
    Obviously, we have to take into account potential clones, so we need to
    check that the actor is not part of a cloned branch of the scene graph,
    as well as checking if the actor has mapped clones.

    actor: Ignore redraws queued on unmapped actors
    
    If an actor is unmapped then it won't be painted, so we can safely
    short-circuit out of _clutter_actor_queue_redraw_full() if the mapped
    flag is not set.
    
    We need, on the other hand, make an exception for Clones, otherwise
    they won't receive notification that the source actor has changed
    and they won't be painted.
    
    This allows us to ignore redraws queued on children of invisible
    parents, and avoid traversing the scene graph.

    actor: Keep track of clones
    
    Instead of using signal notifications, we should be able to keep track
    of the clones of an actor from within ClutterActor itself, using private
    API. There's no point in pretending that people can actually create a
    Clone class out of tree, given the amount of invariants we have to punch
    through in order to implement a proper replicator node of the scene
    graph, so we can just skip the signal emissions and just do the right
    thing at the right time.

    actor: Clean up internal add/remove functions
    
    More comments are warranted: these functions are pretty much full of
    potential side effects, and I'd really like to avoid keeping everything
    in my head forever.
    
    Along with the comments and the type casting reduction, I sneaked in a
    one line change that is clearly correct after reading the flow of the
    whole thing: we queue only a relayout after three potential redraws have
    been queued. If we manage to miss a redraw and yet still get a relayout
    then it means that most of our assumptions are fundamentally wrong, and
    that we ought to dump this whole business of computer programming, and
    just go back to being a hunter-gatherer species.

    a11y: expose the text with password-char
    
    Text exposed by the AtkText methods should be the text
    displayed to the user (like the internal method
    clutter_text_get_display_text). So it should use the password-char
    if it is being used.
    
    This is also a security concern.

    actor: Revert the Transition/Actor leak fix
    
    The original code inside ClutterActor that dealt with Transitions
    stopping was written for the ::completed signal, thus the code was
    correctly handling the lifetime of the instances; when we moved to the
    ::stopped signal, we assumed that it worked in the same way - with less
    conditions to be checked, obviously, but fundamentally similar to the
    ::completed signal. Sadly, I screwed up the signal definition, and the
    signal ended up calling our handlers, but not the default one that did
    the cleanup and released references on the Animatable instance.
    
    After fixing the Timeline::stopped signal, we can go back to the
    previous code.
    
    Thanks to Craig Hughes for the help in tracking down this mess.

    timeline: Use the right function pointer offset
    
    A copy and paste thinko: the ::stopped signal is using the
    ClutterTimelineClass.completed slot instead of the .stopped one,
    thus preventing sub-classes of ClutterTimeline from overriding the
    signal's default closure.

    actor: Release a reference on the implicit Transitions
    
    When stopping the transition we need to release the reference we
    maintain while removing the Transition from the hash table inside an
    actor. If we fail to do so, the Transition is never released, which
    means we leak the Animatable instance we tied to it.

    offscreen-effect: Add a method to get the target area
    
    The target size is not always enough, there are cases where the offset
    used to paint the target must also be available for developers
    implementing an OffscreenEffect.
    
    The get_target_rect() method returns the rectangle used to paint the
    target, with the offsets in the ClutterRect:origin and the texture size
    in the ClutterRect:size fields, respectively.
    
    The get_target_size() method should be deprecated, given that its
    replacement is generally more useful.

    settings: Don't reload config for fontconfig if there's no fontmap
    
    If anything in the system changes the config for fontconfig then an
    XSetting will be set to record the last timestamp of the config file.
    This is presumably so that applications can be notified that it has
    changed and can reload the configuration. However once this setting is
    set it will remain set for the lifetime of the X server. This causes
    Clutter to handle the setting during the initialisation of the
    backend. Previously this would cause problems because Clutter would
    end up creating the default PangoFontMap before the backend has
    created the CoglContext. The PangoFontMap would in turn cause the
    default CoglContext to be created. Clutter will then later create its
    own CoglContext which means there will be two and the first one will
    be leaked. Cogl currently can't really cope with multiple contexts
    being created so it falls apart.
    
    This patch fixes it to skip reloading the config for fontconfig if
    there isn't a default font map yet. The config will presumably
    naturally be read with the latest values when it is finally created
    anyway so it doesn't need to be read immediately.

    Add clutter_stage_set_sync_delay()
    
    New experimental API is added to allow changing the way that redraws
    are timed for a stage to include a "sync delay" - a period after
    the vertical blanking period where Clutter simply waits for updates.
    
    In detail, the algorithm is that when the master clock is restarted
    after drawing a frame (in the case where there are timelines running)
    or started fresh in response to a queued redraw or relayout, the
    start is scheduled at the next sync point (sync_delay ms after the
    predicted vblank period) rather than done immediately.

    evdev: Fix use of the common XKB code for the evdev device
    
    In commit 8f4e39b6d716 the Wayland code was updated to use the new
    xkbcommon API. This involved changing the common XKB code shared with
    the evdev input backend. However the evdev input backend was not
    modified so it wouldn't compile. This patch just makes a minor change
    to update it.

    stage-cogl: Reuse backbuffer contents
    
    Use the buffer_age extension when available to recycle backbuffer contents
    instead of blitting from the back to front buffer when doing clipped redraws.
    
    The picking is now done in a pixel that is going to be repaired during the next
    redraw cycle for non static scences.
    
    This should improve performance and avoid tearing.

    stage-window: make it possible to damage the back buffer
    
    This allows us to report to the backend that the stage's back buffer has been trashed
    while handling picking. If the backend is keeping track of the contents of back buffers
    so it can minimize how much of the stage is redrawn then it needs to know when we do pick
    renders so it can invalidate the back buffer.

    x11: Ignore num lock / scroll lock for event state
    
    As x11 considers num lock and scroll lock to be modifiers, code that
    checks for an exact modifier combination will fail if naively done when
    num lock or scroll lock are turned on. Applications that want to ignore
    these modifiers will need to use XKB to manually mask out the modifier
    state.
    
    As it is very unlikely that applications will want to care about the
    state of num lock or scroll lock for key press/key release events, mask
    out the num lock and scroll lock keys automatically.

    X11: Use XFixes for show/hide cursor
    
    This has been disabled since February 2008, on the grounds that XFixes
    didn't work reliably for hiding cursors.  This has almost certainly been
    fixed then and seems to work entirely reliably across a number of X
    servers released in the past few years, and is definitely better than a
    1x1 black dot for a cursor.
    
    Helpfully though, where the spec states that the cursor will be hidden
    when inside the specified window or one of its children, it actually
    only uses the window to look up the Screen, and hides the cursor across
    the entire Screen.  So, when using this, we also need to track crossing
    events.
    
    If it's still broken, this needs to be fixed in the X server.
