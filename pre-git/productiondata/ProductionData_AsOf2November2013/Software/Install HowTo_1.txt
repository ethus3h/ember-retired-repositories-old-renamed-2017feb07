[ TubeMaster++ Installation Instructions ]

=----- (1) -> System Requirements -----

[+] Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) : http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
[+] Java SE Development Kit (JDK) : http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
[+] LibPcap (Installed by default) : http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpcap/ 

[+] JPcap Library : http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/jpcap/doc/download.html
** You must always be sure that "libjpcap.so" is in "/usr/lib" directory. If not, move it.
	
[+] FFMpeg with FFPlay : 

** Debian, Ubuntu : 
- FFMpeg & FFPlay : Run Command "apt-get install ffmpeg"
- FFMpeg Libraries : Run Command "apt-get install libavcodec-unstripped-52"

** RedHat, Fedora :
- Install RPMFusion Software Provider : http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration
- FFMpeg & FFPlay : Run Command "yum install ffmpeg"

** Mandrake : 
- It appears that running "urpmi ffmpeg" command works but ffmpeg doesn't have all needed libraries.
So you must be sure that FFMpeg is installed with "libxvid" and "libmp3lame".
