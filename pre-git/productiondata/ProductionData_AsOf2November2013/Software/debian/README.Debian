dssi for Debian
---------------

DSSI upstream have stated that as of 0.9.1, the DSSI API will be stable until
2.0.  We have therefore placed all plugins and include files in the default
directories which we hadn't done in the pre-upload to Debian packages.
This means that applications which use DSSI can use the default DSSI_PATH of
/usr/lib/dssi.
