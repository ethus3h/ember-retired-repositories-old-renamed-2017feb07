Some of the menus still do not work (Page encoding).

Thunderbird support: currently, only partially works for main view.

"Work offline", "View->Statusbar" items are always checked.

Design probably doesn't scale well when there are lots of bookmarks, but
the entire XML-based protocol does not either.

Make the image cache global (or per browser instance) instead of per-window
as it is now.
