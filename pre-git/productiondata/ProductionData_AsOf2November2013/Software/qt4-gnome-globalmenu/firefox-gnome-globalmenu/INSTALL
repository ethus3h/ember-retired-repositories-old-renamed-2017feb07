You need the Firefox 9 "SDK", NSPR, and Gtk+ 2.0 libraries and development
headers.

Gtk+2.0 are NSPR are autodetected using pkgconfig.
However, I was not able to find a standardized pkgconfig file for the newer
Firefox's built-in xulrunner SDK. Therefore, you might have to edit the first
few lines of src/Makefile to point to the the paths of the SDK in your system:

* "binpath" must contain xpidl.py, etc.
* "libpath" must contain libxul.so, libxpcom.s, libxpcomglue_s.a, etc.
* "includepath" must contain mozilla/ModuleUtils.h, etc.

Once this is done, to build globalmenu.xpi extension package:

$ make -C src dist

globalmenu.xpi will appear in current directory. Install to Firefox via 
drag and drop or File -> Open file... .
