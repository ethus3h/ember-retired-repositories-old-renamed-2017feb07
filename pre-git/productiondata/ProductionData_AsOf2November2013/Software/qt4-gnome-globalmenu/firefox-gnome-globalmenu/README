This is a Firefox extension that presents the Firefox main window menu on the
Gnome Globalmenu applet ( http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/ ).

It does this by walking the XUL menu structure from Javascript, generating
the required XML code on the go and then sending the resulting XML to
a native XPCOM component (GlobalMenu). The component gets the GdkWindow
associated to the browser window (via nsIWidget NATIVE_WINDOW) and publishes
the global menu atom.
The component also callbacks into JavaScript when menu events are received,
which injects the equivalent DOM events as necessary.

Check INSTALL file for build instructions.
Please check TODO file for known issues.
