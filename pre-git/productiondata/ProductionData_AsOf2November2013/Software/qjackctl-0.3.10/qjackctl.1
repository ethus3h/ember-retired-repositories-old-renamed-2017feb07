.SH NAME
qjackctl \- User interface for controlling JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qjackctl 
.RI [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B qjackctl
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.

.PP
\fBqjackctl \fP is used for controlling the Jack Audio Connection
Kit (JACK) and as a patchbay for ALSA MIDI devices. Qjackctl also has
support for the JACK transport control protocol, so you can use it to 
start and stop the JACK transport. Once you start qjackctl, you get 
presented with a single GUI window, the buttons are self-explanatory 
and have tooltips.
