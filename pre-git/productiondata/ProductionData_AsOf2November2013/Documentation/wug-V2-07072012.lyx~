What is Wreathe?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wreathe is a computer operating system.
 A computer operating system is a set of abstract tools for getting a computer
 perform certain specified tasks.
 Wreathe is designed for

 --- the use of a computer in common home or office applications such as
 word processing, listening to music, or creating and viewing Internet

web sites
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (groups of interconnected computerized documents intended for computerized
 distribution).
 Its abilities are comparable to those of Microsoft Windows or Macintosh
 OS, although each has its strengths and weaknesses.
 This guide provides basic information on how to use Wreathe.
 Note when using this guide that some minor details of appearance or phrasing
 may differ from what is shown in the guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Computer use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, note that a thorough explanation of computer use is beyond the intended
 scope of this guide; only an extremely brief introduction is included here
 for convenience.
 This guide assumes a moderate knowledge and understanding of computers
 and their operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most computers generally need an external source of electricity, so please
 ensure that you are correctly supplying yours with electricity (assuming
 it is necessary).
 Otherwise it will probably not function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A computer generally has three prominent components that you will need to
 use to get Wreathe working in its most basic form: the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

screen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

output
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 device (a way for the computer to communicate information to its user),
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

keyboard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

input
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 device (a way for the user to communicate information to the computer),
 and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pointing device
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (these come in many types), which is also an input device.
 The screen is the part of the computer that displays information visually.
 The keyboard is a method for communicating textual information to the computer.
 Keyboards come in many different layouts, and their usage can vary.
 The recommended keyboard layout for Wreathe (and the one it will attempt
 to use when a keyboard is attached) is, approximately (although the top
 row of keys is missing some of their labels):
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Documents/keyboard-cropped-07July2012

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The pointing device can vary greatly in form and usage.
 It will usually control some sort of positional indicator on the screen,
 and can be used to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

click
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (indicate an action to the computer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Installation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First you need to ensure that your computer meets the recommended system
 specifications.
 It is possible to run Wreathe using a computer that does not meet these
 specifications, but it may not work well and is not recommended for non-experie
nced users.
 The recommended specifications are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At least 1 GB RAM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At least 128 MB graphics memory in a supported 3D graphics accellerator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At least 2 GHz CPU
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An x86 processor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At least 14 GB available hard disk space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before installing Wreathe, it is recommended that you make at least one
 extra copy (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

backup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of any information stored using your computer that you want to retain,
 and that that backup not be within your computer, but rather be within,
 for example, optical CDs.
 You should ensure that any backup you make is readable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To install Wreathe into your computer (assuming your computer has a DVD
 drive), first boot your computer using the Wreathe DVD.
 Then, move your cursor to the upper left of your screen, and click the
 small monochromatic picture of a house (should look something like: 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename /usr/share/icons/AwOkenDark/clear/128x128/places/user-home2.png
	scale 25

\end_inset

).
 Click it.
 Then, click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Install RELEASE
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Next, follow the instructions and answer the questions posed to you, clicking
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Next
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Continue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as prompted.
 If you don't know what you are doing, avoid options marked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

advanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That indicates technically challenging options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Formula $\bigstar$
\end_inset

Important note: If you choose to use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entire disk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for Wreathe, it is likely that any other software, data, or information
 you had previously in the computer will be erased.
 Choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Install along side other operating systems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should eliminate this problem.

Basics of use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you first run your computer and enter your user name and passkey, you
 will see something like this (it has changed slightly since this image
 was created, but the important elements are the same).
 The labels on the picture are not in the real thing.
 In addition, you will never see both the icons (in this reference, the
 word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

icon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used to refer to a small picture or symbol that represents an action
 or functionality of Wreathe) at the left of the screen 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 all three icons at the right of the screen in normal use; they have been
 shown in the same image for illustrative purposes.
 They explain what the elements of the operating system's user interface
 are intended to do.
