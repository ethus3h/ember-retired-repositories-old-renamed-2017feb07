Before you use the Wiki Publisher, ensure that %PRODUCTNAME uses a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). To check the status of the JRE, choose Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Java. Ensure that "Use a Java runtime environment" is marked and that a Java runtime folder is selected in the big listbox. If no JRE was activated, then activate a JRE 1.4 or later and restart %PRODUCTNAME.
