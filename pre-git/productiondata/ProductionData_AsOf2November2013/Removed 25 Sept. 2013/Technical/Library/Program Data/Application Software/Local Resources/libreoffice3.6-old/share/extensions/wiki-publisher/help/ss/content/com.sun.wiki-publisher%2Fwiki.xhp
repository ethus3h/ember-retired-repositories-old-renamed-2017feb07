Installing Wiki Publisher
Before you use the Wiki Publisher, ensure that %PRODUCTNAME uses a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). To check the status of the JRE, choose Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Java. Ensure that "Use a Java runtime environment" is marked and that a Java runtime folder is selected in the big listbox. If no JRE was activated, then activate a JRE 1.4 or later and restart %PRODUCTNAME.
To Connect to a Wiki
Note: You can store your user name and password for all respective dialogs inside %PRODUCTNAME. The password will be stored in a secure way, where access is maintained by a master password. To enable the master password, choose Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Security.
Note: If you connect to the web using a proxy server, enter the proxy information to Tools - Options - Internet - Proxy, and restart the software.
Open a Writer document, and choose Tools - Options - Internet - MediaWiki.

In the Options dialog, click Add.

In the MediaWiki dialog, enter the account information for the Wiki.


In the URL textbox, enter the address of a Wiki that you want to connect to.
